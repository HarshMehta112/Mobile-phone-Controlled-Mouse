# Mobile-phone-Controlled-Mouse
I have created a smartphone application that contains 2 virtual joysticks to move the cursor as well as scroll the screen and also does left and right click just like a regular trackpad.

I made a app using MIT App Inventor and .aia file can open in MIT App Inventor.
